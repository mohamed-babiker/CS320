1) How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I adhere to best practices in software development, which include stringent testing, code reviews, and security audits, to guarantee code operation and security. I also keep up with security risks and take the proper precautions.


2) How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I aggressively involve stakeholders when analyzing user needs in order to gather requirements and maintain open communication. I convert these demands into requirements and user stories that direct the development process.


3) How do I approach designing software?
I concentrate on developing modular, upgradable, and scalable structures while addressing software design. When creating software, I take into account design patterns, user experience, and performance optimization to efficiently satisfy both functional and non-functional needs.
